**Hey, I'm Phuoc Nguyen!** 👋

I'm a software engineer from Vietnam 🇻🇳.

In my free time, I enjoy playing football ⚽ with my co-workers and Nintendo games 🎮 with my kids.

I also take care of my Border Collie 🐕. Here's a little secret: my zodiac sign is the dog.

I hope you find useful things in this digital space 🚀.
